## Motivation
In this pandemic, keeping safe distance from every other person is very essential. However people need to go out to various shops for buying their essentials. 
Most of the times, they get into the crowd unfortunately,resulting in the spread of COVID virus.
It is where this app comes into play. It provides a system to coordinate the movement of people depending on what time they arrive at the
store till the time they leave, which will prove to be very beneficial in the day to day lives of people.

## About the app
People will open the app, login using phone number and OTP, search for his preferred nearby
store, select the items which he wants from the given list of items and finally book the
slot in his preferred time (Each slot has a predefined duration of 15 minutes). 
Now, in order to maintain social distancing, we have put a limit to the number of people in each slot (in ideal
case, it is 5) and that particular slot will not be available to the customer after it crosses
the maximum limit of people.

Once a customer books a slot, a notification will pop up in the corresponding Shopkeeper's app.
Shopkeepers can see the list of items from that app and hence can keep them ready and packed beforehand, so that the cusdtomers don't have
to wait too long at the store. They can just come their alloted time slot, pay and take their packed items home, thereby reducing the crowd at the store considerably.
